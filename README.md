Recently, forest fire and cutting of trees has been a major cause of destruction of trees. Since trees are important to maintain balance in climatic changes,global warmimg and the ever increasing human population, Team Athena decided to build a tree cutting detector and forest fire alert system. The detector works by distinguishing the frequency of the sound when a tree is cut using a chainsaw or an axe. We also tried with various other frequencies to test the model. A total set of 40 such audio clips were obtained. A flame sensor and  a humidity and temperature sensor were used to build the forest fire detector. For demonstartion purposes, an RF module was used to transmit the data from one location to another. However,in real life a LoRa module is more efficient. The source codes of the modules and the sample files are attached.This system can help prevent the mass destruction of wildlife in  a efficient way.
